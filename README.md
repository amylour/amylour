- Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- This GitHub is now dormant. Iâ€™ve stepped away from coding after riding out the highs and lows of the software job market (spoiler: it tanked).
- Iâ€™ve decided to keep my docs live because a lot of time, care, and head-scratching went into them. They might still be useful to someone out there, and thatâ€™s good enough for me.

- No new commits, but you're very welcome to explore whatâ€™s here. Thanks for stopping by ðŸ’»âœ¨
